Description: Estonian DDOC re-timestamping utility
 TeRa is a part of Estonian national ID-card software developed by
 CGI on behalf of governmental institution - Estonian
 Information Systemâ€™s Authority.
 .
 TeRa utility allows you to search local *.ddoc files and timestamp
 them into *.asics container.
 *.ddoc files used SHA-1 hash that might soon be attacable. TeRa
 timestamps found *.ddoc files using SHA-256 and encapsulates them 
 into *.asics container ensuring its validity. No signature is
 added to the container so signature information has to be
 retreived from the encapsulated *.ddoc file (original *.ddoc
 file is copied into *.asics untouched).
